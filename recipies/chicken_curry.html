    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chicken curry from the Indian subcontinent typically features chicken stewed in a tomato-based sauce seasoned with aromatic spices. This recipe, like many others, calls for curry powder (a spice blend made with coriander, turmeric, cumin, and chili powder). </p>
    <p>Saute a diced onion in olive oil until lightly browned. Stir in the seasonings (garlic, curry powder, cinnamon, paprika, bay leaf, ginger, sugar and salt). Add the chicken pieces, tomato paste, yogurt, and coconut milk. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the bay leaf and stir in the lemon juice and cayenne pepper. Continue simmering for about 5 more minutes. </p>
